I would like to present the Text Mining cababilities of **R**. In particular
the framework for Text Analysis with **R** provided by the *tm* package.
Furthermore, I will show the publicly available API for Twitter. Then I will
continue with a case study of Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data/Feedback Data. This has been done with Naive Bayes Classification and/or Logistic Regression. The Case Study involves all the steps from
obtaining raw text data to manipulating the data to running the actual
algoritms adapted for text data. A bit of theory has been provided to motivate
the use of the Bayesian classifier and if time allows I will run model
comparisons.
