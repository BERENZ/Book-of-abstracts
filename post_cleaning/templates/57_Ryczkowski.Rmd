Excel can be a great UI for repetitive, semi-interactive **R** procedures. I
want to present (yet another) solution that allows using **R** commands in
Excel. It features:

* ability to connect to external **R** server so you don't have to be limited by local RAM/CPU
* inspection of variables on external **R** server
* compatibility with RStudio with its awesome step-by-step debugging capabilities

This setup allowed me to create Excel front end for analysis of dataset
with &gt;4M cases and 400 variables.
