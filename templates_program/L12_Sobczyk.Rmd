How to show aging of society? What is a good way to visualize population
projections? How to reveal inadequate public investments related to the
process of suburbanization? Data visualization is a perfect tool to
bring intuitions about those complex and massive problems closer to the
people. In my lighting talk I explore several visualization challenges
related to demographics. For each I propose a solution from my blog
(http://www.szychtawdanych.pl). Examples I show are created with **R** packages *ggplot2*,
*plotly* and *leaflet*. Codes are publicly available on my github http://www.github.com/psobczyk.
