This talk discusses the development of the landscape of packages on Design of Experiments in **R**, the current state of which is documented in the Experimental Design Task View (http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ExperimentalDesign.html). That landscape is quite diverse, currently consisting of (at least) four larger areas and various specialized packages. Descendants and relatives of the pioneering packages *conf.desig*n (2001) and *AlgDesign* (2004) as well as the growing area of packages for computer experiments are considered in more detail, and recent additions based on modern optimization methods are discussed.
