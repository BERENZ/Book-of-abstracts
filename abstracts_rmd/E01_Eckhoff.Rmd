With the advent of the Internet of Things, companies collect a wealth of
data that can be used to monitor degradation of their assets. In this
talk, we will discuss how statistical modelling and machine learning can
be used to predict failures and derive an optimal maintenance strategy.
We will explore different modelling approaches and some of the feature
engineering challenges. Moreover, the high value of combining different
data sources to enrich the model will be explained.
