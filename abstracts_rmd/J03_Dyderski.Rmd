Forest ecology is a
specific branch of ecology, where due to extent spatial scale and large
dimensions of individual objects we often need a special approaches. The
aim of this presentation is to show a few case studies representing
frequent analytical problems in forest ecology and its sources. I will
present problem with unknown variability of studied phenomena on the
example of individual biomass of herbaceous forest understory plant
species. Although minimal sample size was unknown, the biggest
analytical problem was discontinuity of species occurrences, connected
with their specific biology. Thus, instead of two-factor analyses we
performed simple ANOVA and exploratory data analysis to find specific
patterns. In case of the study on alien species natural regeneration,
due to high amount of zero values and lack of good explanatory
variables, we were forced to simplify our densities data into
presence-absence and use logistic model to find interactions between
type of tree stand and distance from the seed source. However, this
interaction is hard to find without graphical data exploration. I also
will present the study in coarser spatial scale, based mainly on
published data on ancient woodland indicator species. This study is a
simple analyses of species richness and use of random forest model to
analyze highly-collinear variables â€“ land-use types within grid square.
Here I will show that simple (ANOVA) and more sophisticated (Poisson
Hierarchic GLM with SAR) statistical approach lead into the same
conclusions. I will also discuss potential sources of outliers and
artifacts, which may be important threat for results interpretation.
