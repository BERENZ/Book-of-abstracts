Hierarchical time series occur when there are multiple time series that are hierarchically organized and can
be aggregated at several different levels based on dimensions such as product, geography, or some
other features. A common application occurs in manufacturing where forecasts of sales need to be made for
a range of different products in different locations. The forecasts need to add up appropriately across the
levels of the hierarchy. I will describe some new features in the *hts* package for **R** which provides several methods for analysing and forecasting hierarchical and grouped time series.
