The travel industry is a natural fit for big data applications -- not
only through the large transaction volumes but also through the
diversity of data sources (e.g.~search, booking, air, hotel, rail,
ground, credit card, expense reports). The challenge is to transform
these data into meaningful information for our various types of
audiences -- from non-technical staff to business intelligence
specialists.

One solution we would like to showcase is the use of \textbf{R}
\emph{shiny} server as the core of multiple technologies. The data flows
from Hadoop via hive to \emph{shiny} server, from which we transform the
data through several \textbf{R} packages, including the famous
\emph{dplyr}, \emph{tidyr}, \emph{data.table} and more peculiar ones
like \emph{data.tree} or ad hoc functions written in c++ to obtain the
most reactive experience.

For this session we would like to present our newly created package
\emph{rHubble}. \emph{rHubble} package ports d3.js via htmlwidgets to
enrich our visualizations by increasing user exploration possibilities,
linking our multiple widgets through pubsub architecture. As the authors
of the package we would be delighted to show its potential.
