Species distribution models (SDM) are mathematical models describing
distribution of species within environmental (ecological) and
geographical space. For example, these models are used for biodiversity
conservation in two ways: to find out threatened species requirements
and to predict spread of invasive species. We aimed to model
distribution of Dicranum viridein Poland and in Europe and compare its
ecological niches obtained by these two models. We choseD. viride, as
this easily-recognizable species is a subject of Natura 2000 protection
and an ancient forest species, may be an umbrella species for numerous
bryophyte species occurring on decaying wood and in old woodlands.
