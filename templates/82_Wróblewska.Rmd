R is powerful tool for data visualization and analysis but it’s speed is
limited to only one CPU speed. It stays in the opposite with current Big
Data trend that focuses on gathering and analysing huge, terabyte-scale
datasets in clustered environment. Combining R and Spark technology we
can synergize power of the both tools and we can efficiently work on
huge datasets. During the presentation we will show you our approach to
analyze search phrases in the biggest polish e-commerce marketplace
platform Allegro.pl. We try text mining methods on phrases that our
users type into the search box. Moreover we analyse transactions and
user search events and try to find out the associations between
searching phrase and successful transactional event. We will focus on
challenges we solved during adapting SparkR in Allegro and share
difficulties we experienced.
