Excel can be a great UI for repetitive, semi-interactive R procedures. I
want to present (yet another) solution that allows using R commands in
Excel. it features
\begin{enum}
 \item ability to connect to external R server so you don't have to be limited by local RAM/CPU
 \item inspection of variables on external R server
 \item compatibility with RStudio with its awesome step-by-step debugging capabilities
 \end{enum}
This setup allowed me to create Excel front end for analysis of dataset
with &gt;4M cases and 400 variables.
