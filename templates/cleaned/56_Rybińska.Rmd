The vast amount of digital information generated every day in social
media, industry and academia necessitates the use of advanced techniques
enabling the processing, analysis and interpretation of data. A
significant amount of data is generated during various types of chemical
experiments. In this work, we present a workflow for predictive modeling
of physical-chemical properties of a diverse group of chemicals (ionic
liquids, ILs). Using selected chemometric methods, available in the most
popular R packages, we analyze the chemical data, model key
physical-chemical properties and validate the results. Moreover, the
presented approach enables the evaluation of the raw data quality. We
choose two unsupervised methods for data exploration: hierarchical
cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Multiple
linear regression technique (MLR) was chosen as the example of a
modeling technique.
