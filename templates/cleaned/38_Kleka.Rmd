In my opinion the methods of statistical analysis are not developing in
psychology, it is happend just beyond. Then methods are only used by
psychologists on their home ground. Such a method, useful for building
typology is latent classes analysis (LCA), which I had "discovered" by
accident. In my presentation, I would like to show how use LCA to
typical psychological data, which rarely meet the requirements of
parametric methods (quantitative measuring scale, distribution
normality, no outliers).
