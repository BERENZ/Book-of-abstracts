Support vector machines (SVMs) are non-parametric methods for various
supervised learning scenarios like classification and regression. They
have been studied extensively both theoretically and practically in the
last 20 years. There are many well-known implementations also for R, for
instance the package 'e1071' provides bindings to LIBSVM. We present our
recent package Simons' SVM for R with the following key features:

UNPRECEDENTED SPEED: - Compared to, e.g. LIBSVM, training that includes
5-fold cross validation on a 10x10 hyper-parameter grid is about 300
times faster on, e.g. a 1000 samples containing subset of the binary
version of the classical covertype dataset. - Partitioning strategies
further decrease training (and testing) time without sacrifying
generalization. For example, the full covertype data set (about 523.000
samples) takes less than 9min. - Partitioning even allows to attack huge
problems. For instance the higgs data set (10 million samples) could be
trained and tested in five hours.

INCLUSION OF SOME STANDARD LEARNING SCENARIOS: - (weighted) binary
classification - multiclass classification (both AvA and OvA) -
Neyman-Pearson-type classification - Least squares / quantile /
expectile regression

FLEXIBLE USER INTERFACE: - Fully integrated cross validation let's the
user focus on parameters he/she can understand. - The underlying
implementation have more than twenty independent otions leading to an
enormeous flexibility for the power user. - Meaningful default values,
which in many cases makes a fine-adjustment unneccesary. - Comprehensive
documentation.
