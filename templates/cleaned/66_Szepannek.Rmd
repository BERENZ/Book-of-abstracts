Most literature in mutlivariate Statistics deals with numeric data, same
for clustering. In practical applications the analyst is often
confronted with mixed type data of both numeric and factor variables.
Hierarchical clustering can easily be extended to categorical data by
specification of an apropriate (dis)similarity measure like e.g. Gower
distance. The k means algorithm relies on euclidean distance. The klaR
package offers an R implementation of the k modes extension to the k
means algorithm for categorical data. Further, the recent clustMixType
package also makes the k prototypes generalization to mixed type data
(Huang, 1998) acessible to R users. Both algorithms are presented
together with their usage in R.
