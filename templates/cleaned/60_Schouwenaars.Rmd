R vignettes, blog posts and teaching materials are typically standard
web pages generated with R Markdown. DataCamp has developed a framework
to make this static content interactive: R code chunks are converted
into an R-session backed editor so readers can experiment. This talk
will explain the inner workings of the technology, as well as a the
tutorial R package that makes the transition to interactive web pages
seamless. Some hands-on examples will showcase the remarkable ease with
which you can convert R Markdown documents, vignettes and Jekyll-powered
blogs into interactive R playgrounds.
