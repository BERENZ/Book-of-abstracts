The presentation covers the main steps of creating a reproducible R
application. First of all, there is a need of collecting the data. We
present how to receive it from various sources, including Kafka,
Elasticsearch or Hadoop (with the help of suitable R packages). After
transforming the data, doing the necessary calculations and obtaining
the desired outcome we show how to push out the results. When the
application is ready and running, it needs to be controlled. We present
the proccess of creating reliable monitoring (with the help of Zabbix
and Hipchat notifications). All of that can be wrapped up in a Docker to
make the application reproducible in different environments and
platforms.
