Working with biological molecules often involves much work with .pdb
files – analyzing, subsetting, transforming and visualizing structural
data. Doing this by hand is tedious, hard to reproduce and prone to
errors. A new R package – pdbeeR – can help you make these chores fun
and save your work as elegant knitr notebooks.
