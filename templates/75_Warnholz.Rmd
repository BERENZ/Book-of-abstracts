In this talk I present the idea of modules inside the R-language.
Modules are an organizational unit for source code. The key idea of this
package is to provide a unit which is self contained, i.e. has it's own
scope. The main and most reliable infrastructure for such organizational
units of source code in the R ecosystem is a package. Compared to a
package modules can be considered ad hoc, but - in the sense of an
R-package - self contained. Furthermore modules typically consist of one
file; in contrast to a package which can wrap an arbitrary number of
files. Inside of packages modules act more like objects, as in
object-oriented-programming. In this talk I cover basic use cases in
parallel computing and good coding practices.
