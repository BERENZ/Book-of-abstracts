Bayesian data analysis is an intuitive and straightforward framework for
doing both inferential statistics and predictive analysis. Because of
its popularity there is now a plethora of R-packages for fitting
Bayesian models. This talk will guide you through the jungle and survey
some of the most useful tools for doing Bayesian data analysis in R. The
talk will feature concrete code examples throughout and does not assume
that you have much prior knowledge about Bayesian statistics.
