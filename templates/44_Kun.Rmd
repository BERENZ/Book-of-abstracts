In this talk we will introduce a concept for an Enterprise R Platform,
starting with expectations towards such a platform, followed by the
benefits and finally giving a reference implementation architecture and
a case study. R users in enterprise settings are often building shadow
IT, with no controls but also no access to efficient code sharing,
automation, deployment, version control, etc. This also means that
others in the enterprise cannot benefit from the R-based solutions. Our
proposed architecture addresses all of these issues by introducing a
playground for the R users and a deployment process supporting all the
flexibility needed while subject to regular controls. Our solution also
includes a way to separate the R projects within a single environment,
so different versions of the same package can be installed for instance.
Finally, by providing a REST API, we enable non-R users to embed the
R-based tools in any other application in the enterprise, ranging from
MS Excel via Java-based ETL tools like Informatica and MI/BI tools like
Business Objects up to and including in-house solutions created in other
languages.
