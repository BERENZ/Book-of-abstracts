Web Analytics is the collection of data and their analysis regarding the
behavior of website visitors. This presentation demonstrates a
walkthrough on how to use multidimensional cluster analysis to divide a
heterogeneous group of website visitors into smaller homogeneous
segments. Focus is the appropriate selection of segmentation features,
the determination of number of clusters and the usage of a
multidimensional clustering technique. All preprocessing, analysis and
visualization is done with the R programming language.
